# BIMarathon2021
The topic of my project is antibiotic resistance in a different group of bacteria to the particular types of druds such as Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Isoniazid, Ethambutol, Streptomycin, and Fluoroquinolone.

The main idea of this project is awareness of the antibiotic resistance problem.

This project focused on the SMART goals, for instance:
Antibiotic resistance is one of the most dangerous and rapidly growing threats to public health worldwide. The problem of antibiotic resistance itself is not new. In 1943, pharmaceutical companies began to produce penicillin on an industrial scale, and Staphylococcus aureus became resistant to this drug within four years. According to the WHO European Region, which includes 53 countries, today more than 50% of infections are caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
In February 2017, WHO published a list of 12 pathogenic microorganisms that pose the greatest threat to human health. New antibiotics are urgently needed to combat them. At the same time, it is known that only two new classes of antibiotics have appeared on the pharmaceutical market over the past 30 years. The non-appropriate usage of antibiotics is a determining factor in antibiotic resistance development.
Tackling antibiotic resistance is an important priority for WHO. In 2015, the World Health Assembly adopted a global plan to combat antimicrobial resistance, consisting of 5 strategic objectives:
• raise awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance;
• strengthen surveillance and research;
• reduce the number of infections;
• optimize the use of antimicrobial drugs;
• ensure sustainable investment in tackling antimicrobial resistance.

Due to its complexity and complexity, this problem went beyond the competence of WHO alone. It is now recognized that no country or organization can tackle antibiotic resistance issues on its own. Therefore, in 2017, this topic was put on the agenda of the UN General Assembly, where a declaration was adopted recognizing antimicrobial resistance as one of the fundamental long-term threats to human health, food production, and sustainable development.
